Therefore, frogs and toads typically cannot mate and produce viable offspring. Frogs and toads are different species. Almost all frogs mate in response to species-specific calls by the males (so the wrong call would be ignored). <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What frogs lay eggs on land?</h2>Among frogs, those of the genus Pristimantis lay eggs on land, which develop directly into miniatures of adults with no tadpole stage.
