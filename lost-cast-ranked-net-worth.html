The endless online theories and discussions were definitely part of the fun. And the popularity of the show made its actors very, very rich.</p><h2 id=terry-o-39-quinn-8-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Terry O'Quinn: $8 Million</span></h2><p><a href=#>Terry O'Quinn</a> is more of a character actor than a blockbuster star, and as such, his net worth is among the lowest of the core Lost cast. O'Quinn has done a lot of TV work since leaving Lost, including 666 Park Avenue, Gang Related, Patriot, Castle Rock, and Perpetual Grace, LTD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, nothing has really stuck, resulting in him often pinballing from show to show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, O'Quinn currently has a salary of $100,000 per episode of TV and an overall net worth of $8 million.</p><h2 id=michael-emerson-8-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Michael Emerson: $8 Million</span></h2><p>There's something cute about Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson sharing the same net worth. Emerson and O'Quinn were often paired together on Lost as the reluctant duo of Locke and Ben, who arguably made for the finest subplot of the entire series.</p><p>Unlike his on-screen partner, Emerson earned substantial work post-Lost, working as Harold Finch on Person of Interest. Despite this, <a href=#>Emerson also receives</a> $100,000 per episode and also has a net worth of $8 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=naveen-andrews-10-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Naveen Andrews: $10 Million</span></h2><p>Andrews is one of the most popular actors from the cast of Lost. For one thing, he was one of the few to receive direct award nominations, earning both <a href=#>Emmy</a> and <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> nominations for his work as Sayid.</p><p>He has starred in the likes of The English Patient, Rollerball, and Planet Terror. He has also done a lot of TV work as of late, starring as Jafar in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Jonas in Sense8, and Julian in Instinct. All this work has <a href=#>resulted in a net worth</a> of $10 million.</p><h2 id=daniel-dae-kim-10-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Daniel Dae Kim: $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Korean actor Daniel Dae Kim made a huge name for himself starring as Jin and rode this fame to more incredible success. Immediately following Lost he began starring as Chin Ho Kelly in Hawaii Five-O and landed a recurring voice role on The Legend of Korra.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Little-Known Details From The Set Of Lost</a></span></p><p>He also starred as Jack Kang in the Divergent series and started a production company called 3AD which currently produces <a href=#>ABC</a>'s The Good Doctor.

Unfortunately, his creative output has slowed in recent years. He created, produces, and stars in a reality program called Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan, although the last episode to air was in March of 2016.</p><p>That same year he starred in the video game Quantum Break as Will Joyce. Despite his lack of recent work, his Lost and Lord of the Rings money has seemingly proven more than enough, <a href=#>judging by his</a> $12 million net worth.</p><h2 id=ian-somerhalder-12-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ian Somerhalder: $12 Million</span></h2><p>Ian Somerhalder was only on Lost for 28 episodes. He played Boone Carlyle, the first major character to die. Luckily, Somerhalder rode this wave to even further success. Beginning in 2009 (four years after his departure from Lost), Somerhalder began starring as Damon Salvatore in the incredibly popular CW teen drama The Vampire Diaries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He remained in the role until 2017 and even served as producer in the show's eighth and final season. His work on The Vampire Diaries has largely contributed to <a href=#>his substantial</a> $12 million net worth.</p><h2 id=evangeline-lilly-15-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Evangeline Lilly: $15 Million</span></h2><p>Lilly has enjoyed what could be the most prosperous post-Lost career. At least within the core cast. Lilly was a nobody when Lost premiered in 2004 - a mere 25-year-old kid from Canada.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Saddest Character Exits From Lost</a></span></p><p>However, she is now known as a major <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star, having appeared in the likes of The Hobbit trilogy (as Tauriel) and the MCU (Wasp from the Ant-Man series and Avengers: Endgame). Despite this, <a href=#>her net worth is estimated</a> at a surprisingly low $15 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-fox-20-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Matthew Fox: $20 Million</span></h2><p>Matthew Fox rivals Dominic Monaghan when it came to the most popular actor of the cast. While Monaghan was fresh off Lord of the Rings, Fox was known for the hit '90s sitcom Party of Five, which had been off the air for nearly five years by the time Lost premiered in 2004. And, like Monaghan, his post-Lost career has been surprisingly slow.</p><p>Perhaps his best work is that of John Brooder in Bone Tomahawk, a horrifying film from director S. Craig Zahler. Fox made good money on both Party of Five and Lost, accumulating <a href=#>an estimated net worth</a> of $20 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=josh-holloway-22-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Josh Holloway: $22 Million</span></h2><p>Josh Holloway made a huge name for himself starring as the hunky antihero Sawyer. After leaving Lost behind, Holloway became a major part of two TV shows - CBS's Intelligence, which ran for just 13 episodes, and USA Network's Colony, which aired for three seasons from 2016 to 2018.</p><p>He is currently enjoying a recurring role as Roarke Morris in the third season of Yellowstone. Amazingly, Holloway has generated a net worth greater than many of his co-stars, as <a href=#>it's estimated</a> in the ballpark of $22 million.</p><h2 id=michelle-rodriguez-30-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Michelle Rodriguez: $30 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michelle Rodriguez wasn't a major member of Lost by any means, starring as Ana Lucia Cortez for 22 episodes of the show. Most of her work came in the <a href=#>second season</a>, although she later appeared as a guest star in the fifth and sixth seasons.</p><p>She is by far the most popular member of the cast (both then and now), having starred in movies like Avatar, Resident Evil, S.W.A.T., and The Fast and the Furious franchise. Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href=#>her net worth</a> is the juiciest of all at an estimated $30 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>15 'Lost' Fan Theories Better Than What They Gave Us In The Last Season</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqKukYrCiv9NmqZqmm5qxbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./spencer-pratt-says-he-helped-lauren-conrad-make-millions-wont-apologize-2013912.html>&#171;&nbsp;Spencer Pratt Says He Helped Lauren Conrad &amp;quot;Make Millions&amp;quot;</a>
