There's no doubt the pair have come a long way since <a href=#>Trump publicly praised Stern at his most iconic hotel</a>. But Stern and Trump's relationship soured over politics. And on April 2024, Stern seemed to continue to try and sway his voters away from voting for Trump by <strong>interviewing President Joe Biden</strong>.</p><p>While <a href=#>Howard Stern first became successful</a> by shocking his audience, he has evolved into a rather prolific and profound interviewer. So much so that a sitting <strong>President sat down with Stern in the studio.</strong> During Stern's April 26th, 2024 interview with the President, Biden revealed the emotional <strong>turmoil he faced when he tragically lost his first wife, daughter, and later his son, Beau</strong>. While Biden has been open about this before, he has really been as raw as he was with the self-proclaimed King Of All Media. This article will delve into what Biden said about the great losses in his life and then delve into <strong>how he met his first wife, Neilia</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=president-joe-biden-fought-tears-while-discussing-the-deaths-of-his-wife-and-kids-during-howard-stern-interview>President Joe Biden Fought Tears While Discussing The Deaths Of His Wife And Kids During Howard Stern Interview</h2><p>The biggest news from <strong>President Joe Biden's April 26th, 2024 interview with Howard Stern</strong> is that he revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's planning on debating former President Donald Trump</a>. But this was really just a throw-away line in the lengthy interview. While Stern certainly set Biden up for a load of soft-ball questions, something that numerous critics have accused multiple interviewers of doing with him lately, the radio legend actually spent the most time on personal matters. Specifically, <strong>Stern inquired about the deaths that have sounded Joe Biden throughout his life</strong>.</p><p>Without question, Howard Stern skillfully and thoughtfully opened the current President up that few have before. Numerous times during the interview, <strong>Biden could be heard choking up and fighting back tears</strong>.

He claimed that this was a fleeting thought in a great moment of pain. Not because he was overwhelmed with grief but because he felt he could never reach the height of happiness he once felt again.

During his interview with Stern, President Biden recalled how his mother and his brothers and sisters moved in with him and helped him put the pieces back together.
