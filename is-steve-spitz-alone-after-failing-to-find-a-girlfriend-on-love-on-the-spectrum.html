As a result of how many people watch Netflix regularly, the streaming service has been able to change Hollywood and television in a lot of ways. On the television side of things, Netflix has proven that millions of people want to see diverse groups of people be centered in the entertainment business. One perfect example of that is even though some people <a href=#>questioned if Love on the Spectrum would be worth watching</a>, the show became a big hit with a lot of viewers.Able to <a href=#>battle a lot of people's misconceptions of autism</a>, Love on the Spectrum helped a lot of people to let go of the stereotypes they had about what it means to be on the spectrum. On top of that, it was wonderful to see so many people that have been ignored far too often in the past have the spotlight.While Love on the Spectrum fans know the show focused on several fantastic people, one of the show's stars appeared to be the most popular by far. Unfortunately for the fans who loved Steve Spitz so much, he didn't find love by the time the show's first season ended. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, has Steve found someone since then?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-the-stars-of-love-on-the-spectrum-us>Who Are The Stars Of Love On The Spectrum US?</h2><p>During the first season of the American version of Love on the Spectrum, the show introduced its devoted viewers to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its incredible cast made up of extremely compelling people</a>.

Bullied throughout his high school years, James has found friends as an adult, loves dressing up in Renaissance fairs, and has dated in the past.

After all, six episodes isn't a lot of time to introduce viewers to so many cast members and show some of the ups and downs in their lives as they navigate trying to find lasting love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-on-the-spectum-s-steve-spitz-with-his-arms-wide-open.jpg><p>Despite the fact that Love on the Spectrum's first season was so short, there was more than enough time for fans to know Steve Spitz enough to adore the man. By far the show's oldest cast member, there was something about who Steve seemed to be on the show and his voice that most viewers couldn't get enough of.</p><p>Only diagnosed with being neurodivergent a couple of years before filming began, that information clearly wasn't a shock for Steve. After all, Steve told Netflix's cameras that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he always understood he was different</a> from his peers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Fans Are Saying About The US Version Of 'Love On The Spectrum'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Growing up, I always knew deep, deep, deep down that I didnât really fit in.

After all, Steve isn't on social media, and it is less likely that members of the media will reach out to interview him as time goes on if he isn't in the spotlight anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side, it still is possible that fans will get further updates about Steve's love life in the future.</p><p>In September 2022, it was announced that Love on the Spectrum US would be returning for a second season. As of the time of this writing, there is no indication if any of Love on the Spectrum's stars from the first season will return, much less if Steve will be a part of the second season. That said, if the show's producers realize how popular Steve is, there is a decent chance he will be back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWjqbK3sYysp6KsqmKurbvNnmSanqSav26ywKKjoqaXYsGwecWipZ1lkWK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZerC6jKWmr51dpLtuwMeeZKyolZjBs8HMaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./john-edward-thomas-moynahan.html>&#171;&nbsp;John Edward Thomas Moynahan Celebsgraphy</a>
