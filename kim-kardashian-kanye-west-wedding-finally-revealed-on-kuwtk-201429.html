Three months after <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong> exchanged vows, footage from their wedding week aired on the season finale of Keeping Up With the Kardashians on Monday, Sept. 1.&nbsp;</p><p>The episode opened with the Kardashian-Jenner clan arriving in Paris for the big day and starting preparations. West, 37, employed his fashion skills in the days leading up to his wedding, helping his now-mother-in-law <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong> with her dress fitting.&nbsp;</p><p>As Jenner, 58, tried on her white gown, she turned to the rapper for advice. Ever the charmer, he told Jenner that her V-neck needed to be lower, while Kardashian chimed in that her mother simply needed a bra. "I don't want to make it too low and be the tramp at the wedding," Jenner spat back.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, it was Kardashian's sisters' turns to try on their bridesmaid dresses. The fitting took a dramatic turn as a pregnant <strong><a href=#>Kourtney</a></strong>, who was still keeping her pregnancy a secret, worried about keeping her growing baby bump concealed in the tight white gown.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Khloe</a></strong> also struggled with her dress, as she, <strong><a href=#>Kylie</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Kendall</a></strong> arrived after the first round of family members and required multiple fittings.</p><p>"I can tell that the girls aren't loving their dresses," Kim lamented. "It's really, really hard to find a dress that will fit all of my sisters' body types. Every single person has a different shape, height, whatever, and when we first ordered these dresses, I had no idea Kourtney would be pregnant. I want everyone to feel really comfortable and just love what they have. It's really hard."</p><p>The ill-fitted gown seemingly rubbed Khloe the wrong way, as she chose to skip the following trip to Givenchy for Kim to try on her wedding dress. "I know Khloe didn't want to come because she's not feeling good about herself… but I really wish she was here to see it," Kim said.&nbsp;</p><p>The dress drama continued, as Kim offered up different dresses for her sisters a couple of days later, under Kanye's direction and with her sisters' input. The women were much happier with the second dress, which Khloe called "a hundred times better."</p><p>The episode also offered a hint at the first signs of trouble with <strong><a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a></strong> during the trip. As Kris was preparing to take her son to his suit fitting, Kim warned, "When you go to Rob's fitting, you have to make sure no one follows you."</p><p>Kris added that while she was "so thrilled" that Rob had "finally made it" to Paris, she was worried about him as her troubled son "just wants to hide in his room."</p><p>"I totally can relate to what Rob's going through, and feeling attacked when everyone is just coming at you and kicking you when you're down and not feeling good about yourself," Kim added of her brother, who has been struggling with his weight. "So it breaks my heart and I feel for him."</p><p>Kardashian and her sisters were then joined by their good friends for pre-wedding festivities at the Eiffel Tower, and a gourmet dinner complete with multiple toasts to Kim.</p><p>As the day inched closer, Kim and Kanye ran through the steps of the ceremony, practicing their kiss, setting up the order of the walk, and deciding who would be responsible for the couple's daughter <strong>North West</strong>, even considering hiding her under Kim's veil.&nbsp;</p><p>The night before the wedding, Kanye surprised his bride's family, telling them that they were all flying to Florence for the wedding. As they arrived in Italy for the ceremony at the 16th-century Forte di Belvedere, the preparation frenzy kicked into high gear. A hungover Khloe struggled to get it together, "holding back throwing up," as they started primping.&nbsp;</p><p>As she got her hair done, Kim showed off the selfie book that she made for her groom, full of individual shots in celebration of their wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>Between shots of the wedding party getting ready, an explanation was offered for Rob's "upsetting" absence. As Kim said, "I wish Rob was here." Kourtney's love <strong><a href=#>Scott Disick</a></strong> explained, "Rob ended up not getting on the plane from Paris to Florence, and he got on a flight all the way back to Los Angeles."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kim called his decision to leave "heartbreaking," adding that she couldn't think or talk about it as she didn't want to cry on her wedding day.</p><p>The excitement continued as Kim put on her final touches, setting her hair and trying on her veil while surrounded by her loved ones. The reality star finally was shown heading out to her wedding in her gown and veil, speaking about how "thankful" she is for her husband.</p><p>As the episode aired on Monday evening, Kim shared another sweet wedding photo of herself and her husband <a href=#>via Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYriiutieZLCdo6l6uLHDnaCnn12btq%2Bty6WwZqqVq7KiuMSdZKimXaDCuMDKZmlpaWRnhg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./onetime-source-of-toothbrush-bristles-nyt-crossword-clue-answer-4-letters-1297958.html>&#171;&nbsp;Onetime source of toothbrush bristles NYT Crossword Clue Answer 4 letters</a>
