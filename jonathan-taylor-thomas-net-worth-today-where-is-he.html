His career took off when he portrayed Randy Taylor on Home Improvement and voiced young Simba in Disney's 1994 animated feature film The Lion King. It was evident from his acting prowess and the colossal fanbase that Jonathan would have a successful career. He did, at least until he quit the hit show Home Improvement and later decided to start directing and producing.</p><p>Jonathan Taylor’s fans have had so many questions about the mysterious disappearance of Jonathan from the limelight. It’s not like he was running from any scandal or had a public breakdown. So, what happened to Jonathan Taylor Thomas?

Jonathan was born in 1981 and made his acting debut in 1990 on The Bradys, a spinoff of an older sitcom The Brady Bunch. The child idol would appear in a few other TV shows before landing a breaking role in the soon-to-be hit show Home Improvement show alongside Tim Allen.</p><p>This show opened more opportunities for JTT, landing him roles in The Lion King and The Adventures of Pinocchio. However, on the 8-season show’s final leg (second episode of season 8 ), Jonathan called it quits. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor later revealed that he wanted to focus more on college and education</a>, and the workload of Home Improvement wouldn’t have allowed that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tim-allen-can-live-on-home-improvement-reruns-alone-but-did-patricia-richardson-lose-out-on-millions_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tim Allen Can Live On Home Improvement Reruns Alone But Did Patricia Richardson Lose Out On Millions?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Patricia Richardson might have lost the opportunity to make a fortune when she said goodbye to the popular sitcom Home Improvement.</span><p>“I’d been going nonstop since I was 8 years old,” Thomas told PEOPLE. “I wanted to go to school, to travel, and have a bit of a break.”</p><p>JTT did not return to the show, something that apparently did not impress his co-stars, Tim Allen and Patricia Richardson. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was speculated that Thomas snubbed the finale because he was mad at Allen</a> for initially questioning his motive for leaving the show.</p><p>“He said it was about going to school, but then he did some films.

All these combined made him quite a net worth. <a href=#>It is speculated that Jonathan raked in $8000 per episode on Home Improvement</a>. Although that figure isn’t precise, it is not a secret that the producers hugely incentivized their cast with money to keep the show going.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tim-allen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Casey Wilson Called Her Time With Tim Allen, "The Single Worst Experience" She Ever Had In Hollywood</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Casey Wilson slammed Tim Allen for his behavior on set of The Santa Clauses.</span><p>Today, <a href=#>Thomas’s net worth continued to grow after Home Improvement</a> to around $16M.
