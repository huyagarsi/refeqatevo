However, if you were seriously delinquent on the account and the credit card issuer sold the balance to a third-party collection agency, you now owe the third-party debt collector.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-charge-off-as-bad-debt-profit-and-loss-write-off-mean></span>What does charge-off as bad debt profit and loss Write off mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A charge-off occurs when you don’t pay the full minimum payment on a debt for several months and your creditor writes it off as a bad debt.

(If the charge-off first appears after six months of delinquency, it will remain on your credit report for six and a half years.)<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-609-letter></span>What is a 609 letter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A 609 Dispute Letter is often billed as <b>a credit repair secret or legal loophole that forces</b> the credit reporting agencies to remove certain negative information from your credit reports.

If you <b>have an outstanding loan that’s a year</b> or two old, it’s better for your credit report to avoid paying it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-a-closed-account-still-reporting></span>Why is a closed account still reporting?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When you pay off and close an account, <b>the creditor will update the account information to show that the account has been closed and that there is no longer a balance owed</b>. … For that reason, even closed accounts with a $0 balance will remain on your credit report for a period of time.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-623-dispute-letter></span>What is a 623 dispute letter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The name 623 dispute method refers to section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
