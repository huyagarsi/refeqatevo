style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>Olivia Jade</strong> joined the cast of season 30 of <strong>Dancing With the Stars</strong>, which caused a huge reaction among people on social media. As the subject of a college admissions scandal in 2019, Jade received mass amounts of hate and criticism online for paying her way into college at USC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jade's parents paid to get Jade into USC, which angered many people, due to the fact that college admissions can be very tough and someone more deserving could have and should have gotten her spot. She even said in one of her YouTube videos that she didn't really care about school and <a href=#>only cared about the parties</a>.</p><p>In an attempt to start a new chapter in her life and show the world who she really is, Jade joined Dancing With the Stars. She is paired with <strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong> and the two seem to be getting along great based on their social media posts. Fans have lots of different opinions about Jade being on the show, however.</p><h2 id=some-fans-don-39-t-like-her-dancing-with-val><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Some Fans Don't Like Her Dancing With Val</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jade was paired with one of the more popular male professional dancers on the show, which gives her a better shot at staying on the show longer, as fans of Chmerkovskiy will likely still vote for him, even if they aren't a fan of hers. Some fans think this was done on purpose to have her stay in the competition as long as possible, instead of getting voted off earlier on.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Olivia Jade Will Donate To 'A Charity' In Effort To Salvage Her Reputation</a></span></p><h2 id=she-39-s-more-known-for-a-scandal-than-for-her-career><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She's More Known For A Scandal Than For Her Career</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the first episode of the season, Jade said in her onscreen interview that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's most known for being an influencer</a> when viewers of the show strongly disagree and believe that she is most known for the college admissions scandal that she was involved in. Before the scandal, she was just an average influencer with famous parents. <a href=#>Her YouTube channel was pretty popular</a> before all the drama and she had quite a large following on social media.</p><h2 id=some-fans-have-jokes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Some Fans Have Jokes</span></h2><p>Some fans of the show just simply joke about her being a college athlete, which she faked in order to get into USC. She claimed to be on the rowing team, which she wasn't. Even though she's not really an athlete, she definitely has some skills when it comes to dancing. Her debut on the show wasn't half bad and she received some positive comments from the judges.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Olivia Jade Wipes The Slate Clean As She Returns To YouTube</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=some-think-she-might-cheat-to-win><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Some Think She Might Cheat To Win</span></h2><p>Fans of the show are making jokes about how Jade's parents might cheat the voting system on Dancing With the Stars so that she can win, similar to how they cheated the college admissions system to get her into USC. Jade seems to want to start a new chapter of her life with the show and to move past the scandal she was a part of, so hopefully, this won't happen.</p><h2 id=some-think-she-39-s-privileged-because-of-her-race><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Some Think She's Privileged Because Of Her Race</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans of Dancing With the Stars believe Jade was unfairly cast on the show because she is a privileged white girl who is being "rewarded" for her crimes instead of suffering consequences. Others are even calling her a spoiled brat. It's no secret that the celebrities on Dancing With the Stars make a great deal of money for being on the show, so it's easy to see why some fans are a bit peeved.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Next For Olivia Jade?</a></span></p><h2 id=some-think-her-mom-got-her-on-the-show><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Some Think Her Mom Got Her On The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of fans are scratching their heads trying to figure out why she was cast on the show, and one person's explanation was that her mom paid for her to be on it. We might not know the exact reason why she was cast, but Dancing With the Stars is known for casting controversial people who are looking to fix their image. Some examples of controversial casting include Carol Baskin, Sean Spicer, Tom DeLay, and Paula Deen. It will be interesting to see if Jade's parents show up in the audience during the season. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her sister was at the premiere</a>.</p><h2 id=some-think-she-39-s-taking-advantage-of-her-scandal><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Some Think She's Taking Advantage Of Her Scandal</span></h2><p>It's easy to see why some fans of the show would believe that Jade is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"cashing in" on the fame she received from the college admissions scandal</a> in order to receive more money and attention that many don't believe she deserves. Lots of people are wondering why she was cast on the series when there are so many other celebrities out there to choose from who haven't been involved in any crimes or scandals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-think-iman-is-a-better-dancer><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Fans Think Iman Is A Better Dancer</span></h2><p>On the first night of the competition, Jade received higher praise from the judges as well as higher scores than her competitor, Imun Shumpert. Fans believed Shumpert had a better routine, danced better than Jade and that he was unfairly criticized. A lot of people on Twitter didn't think Jade was that good and that her scores weren't justified. Her dance partner, Chmerkovskiy, posted on Instagram that she's a <a href=#>hard worker and that she has talent</a>, so he seems to disagree.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans React As 'Dancing With The Stars' Makes History With Their Picks This Year</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiutJmq6GhnqB6oq7Orqtmp5yew6qtjKOYnZ1dl7KqusZmpqdllJa7pLXNoGSwoaSderW0xGaqrZmiqHqisMyiqqyhn6PAbr%2FCmqWdmZxif3F9mGaNmqRdeLWusdGkpq%2Brm57GcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./david-letterman-kevin-durant-brooklyn-nets-media-day.html>&#171;&nbsp; David Letterman Grills Kevin Durant At Nets Media Day, 'Why Do People</a>
