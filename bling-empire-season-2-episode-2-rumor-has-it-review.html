Alex introduced Cherie to Jessey and his wife, Crystal, with whom he shares two children. Alex and Cherie called it quits upon finding out that Cherie and Jessey were involved.</p><p>Kane takes the shocking information personally, questioning his relationship with Cherie. "This is not the Cherie I knew," Kane says, upset that he had to hear this news about Cherie's personal life from a third party rather than from the horse's mouth. With that, Kane plops the table's bread in his bag and departs, prepared to wallow in food.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-opens-up-about-her-relationship-struggles>Kim Opens Up About Her Relationship Struggles</h2><p>Excited about the prospect of a relationship with Kim, Kevin pays for a private date with a chef named Jasper whose intent was to offer the couple a gourmet meal in conjunction with teaching them about the art of preparing a fish.

"I'm not sure if I wanna go there with you," Kim admits, adding that she doesn't want to lose their friendship were they not to work out.

"When I'm in a relationship," Kim notes through teary eyes, "I give my all, and that's very scary to me."

However, it seems the twinkle in his eye that arises upon hearing and spreading rumors will prove to be a saboteur. His sit down with Leah and Jaime seemed to be for no reason other than to further intwine himself in the gossip. If he's going to preserve the friendship he cherishes with Cherie, he'll need to heed Kevin's advice and take a step back from the rumor mill.</p><p>Season 2 of <strong>Bling Empire</strong> is currently streaming, only on <strong>Netflix</strong>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Cherie And Jessey's Relationship Is Called Into Question On Bling Empire</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpaGenHqmuc%2BiqZ5lo5qutLvNZmlmnaCewLCwxGZpZqqloryzeceaqmahpGK%2FpsLInq5o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./melissa-gorga-reveals-her-best-kept-tips-for-bikini-season.html>&#171;&nbsp;Melissa Gorga Reveals Her Best-Kept Tips for Bikini Season</a>
