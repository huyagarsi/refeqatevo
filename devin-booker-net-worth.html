This is according to sources such as <a href=# rel=noopener><u>Celebrity Net Worth.</u></a></p><p>Let us now learn more about where it started for the multiple-time NBA All-Star.</p><p>Devin Armani Booker was born on October 30, 1996, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His mother, Veronica Gutierrez, was a cosmetologist, and his father, Melvin Booker, was a former basketball player who was named the 1994 Big Eight Player of the Year while playing at the University of Missouri.</p><p>His parents met while his father was playing for the Grand Rapids Hoops of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). Melvin Booker went on to play professional basketball overseas, as well as spending a few seasons in the NBA with the Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets, and Golden State Warriors.</p><p>Devin Booker regularly visited his father during the summer. When he was 12 years old, and Melvin was playing in Milan, he played one-on-one with Danilo Gallinari. By the time he was in middle school, Devin became good friends with future fellow NBA players Tyler Ulis and D’Angelo Russell.</p><h2>Devin Booker's high school career</h2><p>For his freshman year in high school, he attended Grandville High School in Michigan, playing for the freshman, junior varsity, and varsity basketball teams. He then moved to Mississippi with his father after he retired from professional basketball. He then enrolled at Moss Point High School where Melvin was hired as an assistant coach.</p><p>Devin Booker scored 54 points against Northeast Jones High School in the Laurel MLK Shootout. He followed it up with a 32-point performance, including the game-winning three, against Murrah High School. His father told reporters Devin drew interest from Mississippi State, Ole Miss, Florida, Alabama, Georgetown, Michigan, and Missouri.</p><p>Devin Booker committed to Kentucky due to the program’s history and affinity for coach John Calipari. On November 13, 2013, he signed a national letter of intent to play for Kentucky with future NBA players Tyler Ulis, Trey Lyles, and Karl-Anthony Towns.</p><h2>Devin Booker's college career</h2><p>At Kentucky, Devin Booker played 38 games during the 2014-2015 season and averaged 10 points, two rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game. He was named to the SEC All-Freshman Team, Second-team All-SEC, and was awarded the 2015 SEC Sixth Man of the Year.</p><p>On April 9, 2015, he announced that he would forego his final years of college eligibility and enter the NBA Draft. He joined fellow Kentucky teammates Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, Dakari Johnson, Willie Cauley-Stein, Trey Lyles, and Karl-Anthony Towns.</p><p>In the 2015 NBA Draft, the Phoenix Suns selected Devin Booker with the 13th&nbsp;overall pick. He then signed a four-year $9.9 million contract.</p><h2>Devin Booker's professional career</h2><p>In his rookie year, Devin Booker became the third-youngest player to score 30 points or more in a game, behind only Kevin Durant and LeBron James. He was chosen to play for Team USA in the 2016 Rising Stars Challenge. Booker competed in the three-point contest during the NBA All-Star Weekend, making him the youngest player in event history.</p><p>He concluded his rookie season averaging 13.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and was fourth in voting for the 2016 NBA Rookie of the Year.</p><p>Before his sophomore year, he was invited to be on the select team to practice against Team USA in preparation for the Summer Olympics. He became the youngest NBA player to score 39 or more points in consecutive games.</p><p>On March 24, Devin Booker joined an elite company, becoming the sixth NBA player to score 70 points in a game. He joins the likes of Wilt Chamberlain, David Robinson, David Thompson, Elgin Baylor, and Kobe Bryant. This was the highest-scoring output since Kobe Bryant’s 81 points in January 2006.</p><p></p><p>The following year, he won the three-point contest, edging out Klay Thompson and Tobias Harris in the final round. However, his whole season was plagued with injuries as he only managed to play 54 games.</p><h2>Devin Booker gets the max contract</h2><p>On July 7, 2018, Devin Booker signed a <a href=#><u>maximum contract extension</u></a>&nbsp;to stay with the Phoenix Suns worth $158.25 million for five years. That contract is paying him nearly $34 million in 2022-23.</p><p>In the 2019-2020 NBA season, Devin Booker was named to his first NBA All-Star Game as an injury replacement for Damian Lillard. He went on to finish the season averaging 26.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game.</p><p>The following year, the Phoenix Suns got a boost with the arrival of Chris Paul. This helped the Suns finish with a 51-21 record, good for the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. As for Booker, he made his second All-Star Game in a row as a replacement, this time for Anthony Davis. Chris Paul and Booker were the first Suns duo to make the All-Star Game since Steve Nash and Amare Stoudamire.</p><p>In the playoffs, they defeated the defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers in six games to advance to the next round. They then swept the Denver Nuggets to get to their first Western Conference Finals since 2010.</p><p>After six games in the West Finals against the Los Angeles Clippers, the Suns advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993.</p><p>In the 2021 NBA Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks, the Phoenix Suns took an early 2-0 lead. Unfortunately, they lost the next four games to lose to Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.</p><p>Despite the loss in the Finals, the Phoenix Suns bounced back the following season to finish with the league-best record of 64-18. The 64 wins set a new Phoenix Suns record for most wins in a single season. Unfortunately, the season ended in disappointment with a disastrous loss to the Dallas Mavericks in the second round.</p><h2>Devin Booker and Kevin Durant team up</h2><p>In the 2022-23 season, the Suns made a big splash by trading for Kevin Durant, giving Booker another high-profile co-star. Phoenix will try to win that elusive first-ever NBA title with Durant in tow.</p><p>Aside from his professional basketball career, Devin Booker was also chosen to represent the United States as part of their basketball team for the 2020 Olympic Games. They eventually won the Olympic gold medal after defeating France in the final game.</p><p>Devin Booker is also active in charitable causes. In 2020, he became the global ambassador of the Special Olympics due to his support for his younger half-sister who has microdeletion syndrome. On top of that, he also has a charitable foundation called the Starting Five wherein he grants five nonprofit organizations $100,000 each.</p><p>In 2022, Booker was on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list. Booker <a style=background-color:#f4f4f4 href=# rel=noopener>partners with brands</a> like Nike, Corona, and Sweetgreen, per Forbes. He has investments in startups such as Buzzer, GoPuff, and Overtime. He also has a role as a co-owner of coconut-water sports drink COCO5.</p><p>Booker is on the cover of NBA 2K23, and he also got notoriety for his relationship with Kendall Jenner. Sadly, the two megastars broke things off.</p><p>Nevertheless, was Devin Booker's net worth in 2023 a surprise?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnKrBpLTPqKCnrKNjsLC5jp2cr6GeYq%2Bwu8qeqWamlal6uLvRrZ8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fifty-shades-of-grey-rating-film-is-r-rated-for-strong-sexual-content-201581.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fifty Shades of Grey Rating: Film Is R-Rated for Strong Sexual Content</a>
