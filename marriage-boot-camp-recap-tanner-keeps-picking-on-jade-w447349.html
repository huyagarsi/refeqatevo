On the Friday, November 4, episode of the relationship rehab show, the couples were challenged with an exercise designed to demonstrate how well (or horribly) they communicated. Spoiler alert: Most couples imploded pretty quickly.</p><p><i>Mob Wives</i>‘ <b>Karen Gravano</b> and her boyfriend,&nbsp;<b>Storm</b>, were still busy berating each other and fighting all over the house. “This is not my thing, and honestly I don’t care,” he said when she tried to get him to join for a one-on-one counseling session. (ICYMI: Storm was still upset that Karen had spoken so openly to a strange, sexy man during a cocktail party earlier about her father’s time in prison.) Karen was “flattered” that Storm cared she had been speaking to another man, but thought he was going about showing his emotions in the wrong way.</p><p><b>Tanner Puts Jade Down</b></p><p>Meanwhile, <b>Tanner Tolbert </b>was busy putting <b>Jade Roper</b> down more and more. He just couldn’t seem to give his wife a break. Jade lamented that it was hard for her knowing that even if she did change, Tanner wouldn’t acknowledge it. Tanner snapped back, saying she facilitated the situation by allowing herself to <a href=#>continue to not have a voice</a> in their relationship.</p><p>When it came time for them to perform the communication exercise — which involved Tanner driving a golf cart blindfolded while Jade directed him where to go — they melted down right away. Jade spent most of the time pointing (which Tanner couldn’t see since he was blindfolded) rather than speaking up, and Tanner had no patience for her mistakes.</p><p>“I don’t think Jade communicates well, so taking directions from her — I can’t say I’m thrilled,” Tanner admitted to the camera. “Thanks,” Jade said sarcastically.</p><p>After watching them communicate (or not) through the exercise,<b> </b>Judge<b> Lynn Toler</b> told Tanner he needed to be more supportive of Jade’s efforts to change. She then gave Jade a megaphone and told her she needed to “find her voice.” Tanner was quite happy about that development.</p><p>“For once, Judge Toler gives her something to work on,” he said with a smile. “Thanks, that’s really supportive,” Jade snapped back sarcastically. At first, Jade managed to talk quietly even with the megaphone, but as the night progressed, she got a bit more confident and a bit louder. It was a baby step, but it was a step just the same.</p><p><b>Jim Tells Amber He’s Going to “F</b>‑‑<b>k the S</b>‑‑<b>t Out of Some Bitch”</b></p><p>Former <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> stars <b>Jim </b>and<b> Amber Marchese</b> had their own meltdown after the communication exercise. That night — when Jim tried having sex with his wife, and she said she wasn’t going to do that with the cameras around — he went ballistic.</p><p>“I just want to be with my wife,” he began. When that didn’t get him anywhere, however, his tone quickly turned. “I’ve had hookers blow me better than you, and you know what? One day I’m going to f‑‑k the s‑‑t out of some bitch, and you’re going to be like, ‘Why’d you do that?’ and I’m going to be like, ‘Remember this night.'” He stomped around the room and added, “I’ll go to hell rather than live in hell for the next 10 years, and you better embrace that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Amber said nothing as Jim’s tirade continued. “I bust my ass.… I take care of you.… I sit with you through chemo, and this is how you treat me?” And while he admitted Amber was a “great mom,” he vowed that the day their daughter turned 18, he was gone. “The day she’s 18, and I’m f‑‑king a 23-year-old, if you are shocked — don’t be! Don’t be,” he said. He then declared that he was going to “j‑‑k off,” like he does every night.</p><p>A tearful Amber confessed to the camera that she fully blamed herself for the situation at hand. “It is my fault,” she said to the camera through tears. “I have been cruel. I have not given him attention, and I need to work on this. I never saw this until I came here.”</p><p><b>Merika and Margeaux Have a Huge Blowout Fight</b></p><p>For her communication exercise, <b>Margeaux</b> had to pick either<b> Merika</b> or <b>Nikko</b> to ride with her in the golf cart. When she chose Nikko, Merika was angry (to say the least). Making matters worse for Merika, Margeaux and Nikko won the challenge, earning a romantic, private dinner away from the other couples that night. (Well, sort of away from the other couples — because Jim and Amber lost, they had to serve Margeaux and Nikko dinner.)</p><p>During dinner, Margeaux and Nikko bonded, holding hands as she admitted that sometimes she wondered if she was still in love with him. That said, she saved her lobster for Merika because she knew how much Merika loved it. Merika, however, was too upset to feel thankful for that gesture. “Did you save your heart for me as well?” Merika asked. When Margeaux didn’t exactly give her the answer she wanted, all hell broke loose, and Merika and Margeaux seemed to break up. Margeaux told Merika she was not her girlfriend anymore, and Merika stormed out.</p><p>Tell <i>Us: </i>Which couple do you think is in the most trouble?</p><p><i>Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars</i> airs on We TV Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqqKerqixjJumqKxdmK6uvIyrnJyZoGLBorrNnqlmo5WavbR5z6KapKGenHqwuoyjmJ2dXayBdYOSbXBo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bobby-mcferrin-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bobby McFerrin Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
