At the time this happened, he was a registered Republican. His employer came to him and asked him how difficult it would be to write code for the voting machines that would "flip" the vote. He told them even that a baby programmer could do that. He assumed that they needed it because the Democrats were cheating -- but when he checked it out, he realized that this was so the Rs could cheat! He left that job and did not do the work -- but somebody did.</p><p>What struck me was when he said that his people had told him, "Look -- the Republicans don't have to win in a landslide -- they can win by as little as 1% and it's still a win." Now, go back and check the percentages most Republicans win by in Florida and see if you don't believe that man was telling the truth.</p><p>Most of his stuff has been wiped off the internet.
